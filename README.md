## üìÅ How to Use

1. Browse the `steam/` folder in this repository to find the game you need.
2. Download the corresponding `.steam` file (e.g., `steam/B/Bastion.steam`).
3. Copy the `.steam` file to your ES-DE `ROMs/steam` folder on your Android device.
4. Launch ES-DE. It will use the `.steam` file to start the game in GameNative or GameHub Lite.

Further details for setting up the steam system on ES-DE is covered in the [ES-DE Userguide](https://gitlab.com/es-de/emulationstation-de/-/blob/master/USERGUIDE.md?ref_type=heads#steam) 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not copy the entire `steam/` folder**.  
> Only copy the `.steam` files for games you actually have installed.
> Importing all entries may make ES-DE extremely **slow and unresponsive**.
