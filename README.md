# 🎮 .steam Files for ES-DE on Android

This repository contains a full set of .steam files generated from the official Steam App list.

Each file contains the Steam App ID, formatted for compatibility with launching GameNative or GameHub Lite games from ES-DE on Android.

## 📁 How to Use

Browse to the folder for the game you need inside the steam/ directory.

Download the corresponding .steam file (for example: steam/B/Bastion.steam).

Copy it to your ES-DE ROMs/steam folder on your Android device.

ES-DE can then use these files to launch games installed in one of the compatible emulators (GameNative, GameHub Lite).


## ⚠️ **Warning:**  
> Do **not** add the entire `steam/` folder from this repository to ES-DE.  
> This repository contains **hundreds of thousands of Steam entries**, and importing all of them will make the app **extremely slow or unresponsive**.  
>  
> Only copy the specific `.steam` files for games you actually have installed.


## 🔄 Automatic Updates

This repository is refreshed automatically each day using the Steam Web API to include newly released games and updates.
